=head1 NAME

RPi::HCSR04 - Interface to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement sensor
on the Raspberry Pi

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RPi::HCSR04;

    my $trig_pin = 23;
    my $echo_pin = 24;

    my $sensor = RPi::HCSR04->new($trig_pin, $echo_pin);

    my $inches = $sensor->inch;
    my $cm     = $sensor->cm;
    my $raw    = $sensor->raw;

    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Easy to use interface to retrieve distance measurements from the HC-SR04
ultrasonic distance measurement sensor.    

Requires L<wiringPi|http://wiringpi.com> to be installed.

=head1 VOLTAGE DIVIDER

The HC-SR04 sensor requires 5V input, and that is returned back to a Pi GPIO
pin from the C<ECHO> output on the sensor. The GPIO on the Pi can only handle
a maximum of 3.3V in, so either a voltage regulator or a voltage divider must
be used to ensure you don't damage the Pi.

Here's a diagram showing how to create a voltage divider with a 1k and a 2k
Ohm resistor to lower the C<ECHO> voltage output down to a safe ~3.29V. In this
case, C<TRIG> is connected to GPIO 18, and C<ECHO> is connected to GPIO 23.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates and returns a new L<RPi::HCSR04> object.

Parameters:

    $trig

Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number of the Raspberry Pi that the C<TRIG>
pin is connected to.

    $echo

Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number of the Raspberry Pi that the C<ECHO>
pin is connected to.

=head2 inch

Returns a floating point number containing the distance in inches. Takes no
parameters.

=head2 cm

Returns a floating point number containing the distance in centemetres. Takes
no parameters.

=head2 raw

Returns an integer representing the return from the sensor in raw original
form. Takes no parameters.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

* L<wiringPi|http://wiringpi.com> must be installed.
* At this time, your program will have to be run as root (under C<sudo>).
* You must regulate the voltage from the C<ECHO> pin down to a safe 3.3V from
the 5V input. See L</VOLTAGE DIVIDER> for details.
