NAME

    RPi::HCSR04 - Interface to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement
    sensor on the Raspberry Pi

SYNOPSIS

        use RPi::HCSR04;
    
        my $trig_pin = 23;
        my $echo_pin = 24;
    
        my $sensor = RPi::HCSR04->new($trig_pin, $echo_pin);
    
        my $inches = $sensor->inch;
        my $cm     = $sensor->cm;
        my $raw    = $sensor->raw;
    
        ...

DESCRIPTION

    Easy to use interface to retrieve distance measurements from the
    HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement sensor.

    Requires wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com> to be installed.

VOLTAGE DIVIDER

    The HC-SR04 sensor requires 5V input, and that is returned back to a Pi
    GPIO pin from the ECHO output on the sensor. The GPIO on the Pi can
    only handle a maximum of 3.3V in, so either a voltage regulator or a
    voltage divider must be used to ensure you don't damage the Pi.

    Here's <https://stevieb9.github.io/rpi-hcsr04/hcsr04.png> a diagram
    showing how to create a voltage divider with a 1k and a 2k Ohm resistor
    to lower the ECHO voltage output down to a safe ~3.29V. In this case,
    TRIG is connected to GPIO 23, and ECHO is connected to GPIO 24.

METHODS

 new

    Instantiates and returns a new RPi::HCSR04 object.

    Parameters:

        $trig

    Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number of the Raspberry Pi that the
    TRIG pin is connected to.

        $echo

    Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number of the Raspberry Pi that the
    ECHO pin is connected to.

 inch

    Returns a floating point number containing the distance in inches.
    Takes no parameters.

 cm

    Returns a floating point number containing the distance in centemetres.
    Takes no parameters.

 raw

    Returns an integer representing the return from the sensor in raw
    original form. Takes no parameters.

REQUIREMENTS

      * wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com> must be installed.

      * You must regulate the voltage from the ECHO pin down to a safe 3.3V
      from the 5V input. See "VOLTAGE DIVIDER" for details.
